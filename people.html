	<strong>Zebulon Bell</strong> grew up in Podunk, Alabama, and you can tell from just hearing him speak for a few seconds. He is a drummer, so imagine what his personality is like just based off of that and you're probably close enough. Zeb does things to animals and then writes papers about it. He hangs out at the Zoo and listens to way too much butt rock. He earned his Ph.D. from Oakland University.
